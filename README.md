### Long Version

Greetings and welcome to my repository for personal development notes. This repository has been created to compile and organize all my annotations from my career and academic studies. It serves as a comprehensive knowledge map that encompasses my daily work experiences, coursework, and various other subjects of interest.

The goal is to group the key concepts in a way that gives you a solid base to dive into official docs or other resources on your own.

The content in this repository is derived from courses and articles I have read, and I make use of AI to simplify the explanations and give cohesion to the notes. Additionally, I have included sections that provide quick guides and other useful information. Every effort will be made to provide relevant references and citations.

Please keep in mind that this content is constantly evolving and being updated. I am aware that there is much more to learn, and I do not claim that this material is complete. If you encounter any information that is inaccurate or outdated, do not hesitate to contact me. I hope you find this material valuable in some way.
